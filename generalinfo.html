					  <h3>Cape Town </h3>
                      <p>Perched between the ocean and the mountain, with a national park as its heart, there is nowhere like Cape Town. Cape Town, the &ldquo;Mother City&rdquo;, is the oldest city in South Africa and has a cultural heritage spanning more than 300 years.</p>
					  
                      <p>It is in Cape Town that the Rainbow Nation really covers the spectrum. Between beautiful Cape Dutch homesteads, traditional dancers with painted faces performing in the streets, the smell of spicy Malay cooking and the taste of a well-made wine, this city will fill your senses. </p>
					  
					  <p>It has the top five national attractions in South Africa. These include a visit up Table Mountain, either by cable car (closed during the Annual Meeting period) or manually climbing up routes of varying degrees of difficulty; and the Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens, internationally acclaimed as one of the great botanical gardens of the world. The Victoria &amp; Alfred Waterfront, one of the city&rsquo;s main tourist attractions, offers the visitor a unique shopping and holiday experience on a scenic working harbour. </p>
					  
                      <p>Looking further offshore, visitors can take a boat ride to Robben Island, where Nelson Mandela was imprisoned by the apartheid government. Visitors to the island are taken on a tour of the old prison complex, as well as to a museum on the island. </p>
					  
                      <h3>Weather </h3>
                      <p>Cape Town&rsquo;s location on the south coast of South Africa means it enjoys a Mediterranean climate. In late August, the weather in Cape Town will be transitioning from a cold winter into a sunny spring. As per average weather forecast, during the period of the NDB Annual Meeting, the estimated high is 23°C (73°F) and the estimated low is 13°C (55°F) with the slight chance of wind and rainfall. </p>
					  
                      <h3>Time Zone </h3>
                      <p>South African Standard Time is two hours ahead of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT+2). The same time zone is used all over the country. </p>
					  
                      <h3>International Health Regulations </h3>
                      <p>In line with the International Health Regulations South Africa requires a valid yellow fever certificate from all citizens and non-citizens over one year of age:  </p>

                      <h3>Currency, Credit Card and ATMs </h3>
                      <p>The official currency in South Africa is the Rand, which is divided into 100 cents. Notes come in denominations of R10, R20, R50, R100 and R200, and coins come in 5c, 20c, 50c, R1, R2 and R5. All transactions are rounded down to the nearest 5c.  </p>
					  <p>The major banks have branches as well as automated teller machines (ATMs) in most large towns – and all over the cities. ATMs are linked to all major international networks, and it is possible to draw currency from them. They accept Mastercard and Visa debit cards. Participants should be mindful to international ATM fees each they withdraw money from an ATM. Conveniently, there are multiple ATM&rsquo;s at the CTICC. </p>
					  <p>Banks are generally open from 8:30am or 9:00am to 3:30pm Monday to Friday, and 8:30am to 11:00am on Saturday. Many bank outlets in larger towns, and especially those in shopping centers, have extended these hours, and some are open on Sunday. Branches at airports adjust their hours to accommodate international flights.  </p>
					  <p>All major credit cards can be used in South Africa. Pin-based debit cards are often accepted too. Make sure you tell your card issuer about your travel plans as your bank may block your card if you make a payment or withdrawal in South Africa.  </p>
					  <p>To exchange cheques for cash at foreign exchange dealers, you must present a valid passport. Travellers cheques can be cashed at all banks, bureau de change and at some hotels. Remember that all money transactions that involve foreign exchange must be done by authorised dealers. In terms of exchange control regulations, it is illegal to buy or sell foreign currency to anyone except an authorised dealer.  </p>
					  <p>Forex services are offered by Absa, FNB, Nedbank and Standard Bank and credit card companies. </p>
                       <p>South African businesses only accept Rands. It&rsquo;s advised that participants switch currency on arrival and for safety purposes, mostly swipe cards. </p>
					  
                      <h3>Electricity Supply </h3>
                      <p>In South Africa the standard voltage is 230 V and the frequency is 50 Hz. The two types of plug points used in South Africa are a two-pronged plug (type C and type F), and a three-pronged plug (type M). Please consider purchasing the corresponding international plug adaptors as required. </p>
                      <div class="hotelimg"><img src="assets/img/plug.png" alt="" class="img-fluid"/></div>
					  
					  <h3>International Dialing Code </h3>
                      <p>The country code for South Africa is 27. The area code for Cape Town is 021 (012 for Pretoria and 011 for Johannesburg). To make an international phone call, dial 00 + country code + area code (zero dropped) + phone number. The area code is omitted when dialing mobile phone numbers. </p>
					  
                      <h3>Safety </h3>
                      <p>Cape Town is one of the best tourism destinations in the world. The Cape Town Tourism Department would like to offer the following guidance concerning the safety and well-being of all visitors to the Mother City. </p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Avoid carrying large sums of cash, don&rsquo;t carry cameras in plain sight and do not leave belongings unattended. </li>
                        <li>Heed the advice of your hosts, Cape Town Tourism Visitor Centre staff, or locals on where to go after dusk. Avoid walking in deserted and dark places at night. Park in a secure, well-lit area with street guards. (edit locals) </li>
                        <li>Never allow strangers to assist you in any way at ATMs or cash points. </li>
                        <li>Street children and beggars may approach you for a donation. </li>
                        <li>Keep copies of all valuable documents in a safe place. </li>
                        <li>When exploring Table Mountain National Park, walk in groups, take a map, comfortable walking shoes, and keep a charged mobile phone. </li>
                        <li>When hiking, be prepared for weather that can change rapidly, even in summer. Bring along enough water and sunblock, as well as something warm to wear. Start heading back well before dark and don&rsquo;t venture away from the demarcated paths. Tell a friend or your host where you are going and when you expect to be back. </li>
                      </ul>
